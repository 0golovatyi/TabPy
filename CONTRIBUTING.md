## Environment Setup

TabPy suggests using [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org) to configure and manage your development environment out of the box and provides facilities to enable this out of the box. To start, clone the source code and from the project root run:

```sh
pipenv install -dev
```

This will create a dedicated virtual environment containing all of the development requirements, which you can subsequently activate to get started:

```sh
pipenv shell
```
